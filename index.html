          John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born outside Boston in Brookline,
          Massachusetts on May 29, 1917, at 83 Beals Street, to Joseph P.
          Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician, and Rose Kennedy (n√©e
          Fitzgerald), a philanthropist and socialite. His paternal grandfather,
          P. J. Kennedy, served as a Massachusetts state legislator. Kennedy's
          maternal grandfather and namesake, John F. Fitzgerald, served as a
          U.S. Congressman and was elected to two terms as Mayor of Boston. All
          four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants. Kennedy
          had an older brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings:
          Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean, and Edward.

          Kennedy lived in Brookline for the first ten years of his life. He
          attended the local St. Aidan's Church, where he was baptized on June
          19, 1917. He was educated through the 4th grade at the Edward Devotion
          School, the Noble and Greenough Lower School, and the Dexter School;
          all located in the Boston area. In September 1930, Kennedy, then 13
          years old, was shipped off to the Canterbury School in New Milford,
          Connecticut, for 8th grade. In April 1931, he had an appendectomy,
          after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home. In
          September 1931, Kennedy started attending Choate, a prestigious
          boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut, for 9th through 12th
          grade. In 1940, Kennedy graduated cum laude from Harvard with a
          Bachelor of Arts in government, concentrating on international
          affairs.

          In January 1942, Kennedy was assigned to the ONI field office at
          Headquarters, Sixth Naval District, in Charleston, South Carolina. He
          attended the Naval Reserve Officer Training School at Northwestern
          University in Chicago from July 27 to September 27 and then
          voluntarily entered the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center
          in Melville, Rhode Island. Kennedy completed his training on December
          2 and was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron FOUR.
